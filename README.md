**TODO:**                                             
- [x] Play command
- [x] Play wav files

**EPOCH 1 Plans**
- [x] -p flag will default to playing simple_audio
- [x] sequential play added
- [x] overlapping play added
- [ ] -p -s : plays files sequentially.
    - this just needs a if statement to check for a flag, then call get_queue on the input, then calls play_sequentially on the return of that
- [ ] -p -t : plays files on top of each other.
    - ditto
