## EPOCH ONE REQS
- [x] A user must be able to interact with your program from the command line via a simple text-based interface.
- [x] From that command-line interface, the user should be able to get a list of available commands.
- [x] A user must be able to get a list of available sounds to play.
- [x] A user must be able to play back a single sound.
- [x] A user must be able to listen to multiple sounds simultaneously (i.e., layer multiple sounds on top of each other).
- [x] A user must be able to listen to a sequence of sounds.
- [x] A user must be able to rename a sound.
- [x] These requirements may be met either with a single large command-line program that implements all of them, or by a suite of smaller command-line programs that focus on a subset of features
